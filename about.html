            General information
        </h2>

        <p>
            The Mighty Ducks Hockey League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing in
            Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment in which to learn and play hockey. To be a
            member of MDHL, you must be between the ages of 4 -12 and reside in a Chicago northside
            neighborhood. MDHL is ran by a small fulltime staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time of
            parents and previous league members.
