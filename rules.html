                youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach, 
                team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from 
                this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey

a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or associations participating in 
the state competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these 
minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will 
assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board 
whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams 
from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable 
field may be required to play all their games away.
